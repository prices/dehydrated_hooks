# Dehydrated hooks
Hooks for the dehydrated acme client.  For the most part, these are quick and dirty hacks to get things working.
If they work for you great!  If not, please put in a pull request.

# Hooks
## gds_api.js
This is a hook for Google Domains ACME API.  If your domains are stored at https://domains.google.com this is the
hook you need.

# Pull Requests
I welcome pull requests.

# Notes
I hope this is useful to you, but I don't guarantee that it will work, and I don't have the time to really do tech
support on it that is not related to an actual bug in the code.
